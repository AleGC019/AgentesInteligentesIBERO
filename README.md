## üåü Introduction
Intelligent agents are autonomous entities that observe and act upon an environment to achieve specific goals. This repository showcases various activities and projects that demonstrate the capabilities and applications of intelligent agents in different scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Activities

### 1. Data Preprocessing
In this activity, we focus on preparing the data for training intelligent agents. This includes:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing and scaling features

### 2. Model Training
Here, we train different machine learning models to act as intelligent agents. The models included are:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

### 3. Model Evaluation
This activity involves evaluating the performance of the trained models using various metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

### 4. Predictions
In this section, we use the trained models to make predictions on new data and analyze the results. We also count the number of survivors and non-survivors predicted by each model.
